If you just want the pdfs you can just grab those from the pdfs folder.

If you want to make changes to the source you'll need to install a standard LaTeX distribution (e.g. TeXLive) for pdflatex, the Acrotex packages for form inputs, a copy of make if you don't have it, and text editor of your choice.
